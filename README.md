Tankz; A Lot is a multiplayer (currently 2-player) iOS game which takes advantage of Apple's "Multipeer Connectivity" framework in order to offer connected play without requiring a central server, wifi, or 3g network connection. This game can be played in the car, on a bus, on a plane, or in the middle of nowhere!

This iOS game was developed by Site Mao, Jonathan Tan, Kevin Jonaitis, and Joseph Colicchio. It was developed over the course of 36 hours for the LAHacks hackathon. It was more of a personal challenge to explore an interesting new technology, so we neglected to incorporate any APIs into our game. However, three of our four developers were completely new to iOS prior to this event, and despite this hurdle, all developers were able to learn something and put together a working product. I think that's pretty damn cool.
